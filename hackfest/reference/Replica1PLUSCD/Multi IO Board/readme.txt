The 2 text file dumps are samples of the serial version of the Woz monitor.

One is located in the 32K RAM area at 7F00-7FFF and the other is located in the EEPROM on the multi I/O board at A000-A0FF. 

Keep in mind that once you start a Apple 1 program that was downloaded via the serial Woz monitor that the default display (TV and keyboard) will be used instead of the serial Woz. 

Set your terminal program up at 19200 BAUD 8 bit 1 stop no parity. When you start the program, hit ESC on your PC computer to establish communication.
